The AI engineer successfully built the Credt application from a high-level description, evolving it through several iterations. Initially, the core value proposition of optimizing credit utilization by timing notifications for payments before statement close dates was identified. The first MVP focused on Plaid integration and a MongoDB backend for credit card data. Significant effort was dedicated to debugging frontend loading issues and Plaid Link functionality, often stemming from state management and React Strict Mode. Following user feedback, the architecture was re-evaluated, leading to a migration from MongoDB to Supabase for robust authentication and user-specific data handling. Extensive UI/UX refinements were made, transforming static dashboards into mobile-friendly, interactive layouts with clear recommendations and categorized card views. The app's branding was also corrected to Credt. The current phase involves hardening the backend for production, re-enabling authentication, and implementing crucial security measures like token encryption and input validation.

The user requested a mobile-first application, named Credt, designed to help individuals optimize their credit utilization. The core problem addressed is that credit card issuers report balances on statement closing dates (typically 21-25 days before due dates), which can negatively impact credit scores even for users who pay in full by the due date. The app's primary functionalities include:
1.  **Credit Card Data Integration**: Use Plaid to access real-time credit card information.
2.  **Statement Cycle Calculation**: Infer and track each credit card's statement closing dates.
3.  **Utilization Optimization**: Calculate optimal payment amounts to achieve target utilization bands (e.g., 0-9%) before statement close dates.
4.  **Notifications**: Send timely alerts with exact payment amounts and deadlines.
5.  **Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard displaying current utilization, projections, and month-over-month changes.
6.  **User Authentication**: Implement user signup/login and manage user-specific data securely, transitioning from an initial MongoDB setup to Supabase.
UI/UX was iteratively refined to ensure clarity (e.g., specific payment dates instead of days left, Pay X amount clearly stated), mobile-friendliness (expandable card sections for Healthy Cards and Cards Need Attention), and a streamlined layout focusing on urgent recommendations and interactive overviews. The application is now being prepared for production, requiring robust backend security.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: This file serves as the unified backend API endpoint. Initially implemented with MongoDB for data operations, it was later completely rewritten to integrate with Supabase. It handles Plaid link token generation, the secure exchange of public tokens for access tokens, and fetching/processing dashboard data including credit utilization calculations and payment recommendations. This file abstracts the database interaction, now primarily using Supabase.
-   ****: This is the main client-side React component responsible for rendering the Credt dashboard. It manages a significant amount of local state, including loading indicators, error messages, fetched dashboard data, active tabs (Recommendations/Analytics), and the expanded state of card sections (Healthy Cards, Cards Need Attention). It integrates the  hook for Plaid integration, processes API responses, and renders the complex, mobile-optimized UI with dynamic content and interactive elements. It also contained temporary mock data for UI visualization, which is in the process of being removed.
-   ****: Defines the root layout structure for the Next.js application, applying global styles and encapsulating shared UI elements.
-   ****: This newly created API route is essential for Supabase authentication. It handles the callback after a user clicks a magic link (or other authentication methods), processing the Supabase session and redirecting the user appropriately.
-   ****: This file stores critical environment variables, including  (legacy, not used for current app data), , Plaid credentials (, , ), and Supabase credentials (, , ).
-   ****: A SQL script that defines the database schema for the Supabase project. It includes table creations (e.g., , , ) and sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data privacy and user-specific data access.
-   ** and **: These utility files export configured Supabase client instances.  is used for client-side interactions (e.g., from ), while  is used for server-side operations (e.g., from API routes).
-   ****: This file was recently created to house utilities for encrypting sensitive data, specifically Plaid access tokens, before they are stored in the database, aligning with Plaid's security requirements.
-   ****: This file was recently created to contain logic for validating incoming data and API requests, which will leverage Zod for schema enforcement, improving backend robustness and security.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the backend security implementation, specifically adding  for robust data validation in .
-   Integrate the token encryption utility () for Plaid access tokens.
-   Remove all mock data from the frontend and restore the full Supabase authentication and Plaid integration flow for real user data.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the crucial phase of preparing the Credt application for production. This involves a comprehensive audit and implementation of backend security measures, adhering to Plaid's security requirements. The current focus is on transitioning the application from displaying mock data back to requiring user authentication via Supabase and integrating with Plaid for real financial data.

To enhance the backend's security, the AI has researched Plaid's latest security, encryption, and validation best practices. As a direct result of this research, two new utility files have been created in the  directory:
1.  ****: This file is intended to contain functions for encrypting sensitive information, such as Plaid access tokens, before they are stored in the database.
2.  ****: This file will house the logic for robust data validation for all incoming API requests, ensuring data integrity and preventing common security vulnerabilities.

The immediate next step in this process is to integrate the  library, which will be used to define schemas and perform the validation in .
